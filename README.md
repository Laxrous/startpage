# SNSD Themed Startpage
My personal version of [TheProtagonists's SPECTRUMStartpageV3](https://github.com/TheProtagonists/SPECTRUMStartpageV3).

A startpage is the homepage of your internet browser. A regular user may know this as the first page they see when the open their internet browser and it's where they can find their top sites or most recent sites that they use.

### Main Changes
- Removed the Date/Time display
- Buttons are based off each SNSD member
- The blur is from the image, not from code.
- Search bar is still there, just hidden until focused.
- Search bar allows URLs

Any future changes will most likely be position changes or new links. Or maybe when I get tired of this background image, I'll redo everything.
